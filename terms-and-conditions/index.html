        <h1>toolsandmachinery.co.uk User Agreement - Essential Rules and User Guidelines</h1>

        <p>Welcome to toolsandmachinery.co.uk. These Terms and Conditions ("T&Cs") govern your use of our website,
            services, and content. By accessing and using our site, you expressly agree to these terms. If you do not
            agree to all provisions, please do not use our services.</p>

        <h2>How to Access and Responsibly Use the Services of toolsandmachinery.co.uk</h2>
        <p>Our website provides editorial content, information, and guides on entertainment games and casino platforms
            such as Fortunica Casino. Access is open to users worldwide, subject to any local legal restrictions. You
            are solely responsible for ensuring your use of our content complies with the laws of your country. We
            promote responsible gambling behaviour and provide informative resources intended to enable decisions based
            on informed judgment.</p>

        <h2>Strict Age Verification and Legal Compliance Policies</h2>
        <p>Our content is intended exclusively for persons who have reached the legal minimum age for gambling in their
            respective jurisdiction. In the United Kingdom and most countries, this minimum age is 18 years. By
            accessing our content, you confirm and warrant that you have reached this minimum age. We reserve the right
            to deny access if we have reason to believe this condition is not met.</p>

        <h2>Binding Acceptance of Terms and Ongoing Updates</h2>
        <p>Your continued use of the website constitutes ongoing acceptance of these T&Cs. We reserve the right to
            change, modify, or update these terms at any time at our sole discretion. Changes will become effective by
            posting the updated T&Cs on this page. It is your responsibility to check this page periodically for
            changes. Your further use following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</p>

        <p>toolsandmachinery.co.uk functions as an independent information portal. We provide editorial reviews, game
            guides, news, bonus information, and general guides related to online casinos and games. We are not an
            online casino, do not accept bets, and do not pay out winnings. We may link to external third-party websites
            that offer gambling services. For all transactions, deposits, withdrawals, bonus terms, or disputes with
            these third parties, their respective terms and conditions are solely applicable.</p>

        <h2>Protection of Intellectual Property and Usage Rights</h2>
        <p>All content on this website, including text, graphics, logos, images, audio and video clips, software, and
            the compilation and layout, is our property or that of our content suppliers and is protected by UK and
            international copyright laws. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to access
            and make personal, non-commercial use of the website. Any other reproduction, distribution, modification, or

        <p>You agree to use the website in a legal, ethical manner and respectfully towards other users. Any behaviour
            deemed harassing, threatening, fraudulent, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise unlawful or objectionable is
            strictly prohibited. You may not disrupt, excessively burden, or circumvent the security or integrity of the
            website's systems or processes.</p>

        <h2>Prohibited Behaviours and Robust Abuse Prevention</h2>
        <p>Activities expressly prohibited include, but are not limited to: the use of bots, crawlers, or other
            automated means to access the website; reverse engineering or decompiling software; distributing malware;
            performing DoS attacks; unauthorised collection of other users' data; and any action that violates
            applicable gambling laws. Violations may result in immediate access revocation and legal action.</p>

        <h2>Transparency Regarding Third-Party Links and External Content</h2>
        <p>Our website may contain links to third-party websites that are not owned or controlled by us. We have no
            control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of these websites.
            The inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement, approval, or partnership with that third party.
            Accessing linked websites is at the user's own risk.</p>

        <h2>Clear Policies on Account Suspension and Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion and without prior notice or liability, to deny, restrict, or
            terminate your access to this website or parts thereof for any reason, including but not limited to a breach
            of these T&Cs or applicable law. Upon termination, all provisions of these T&Cs which by their nature should
            survive will remain in effect, including but not limited to ownership provisions, disclaimers, and
            indemnities.</p>

        <h2>Definition of Liability, Legal Obligations, and Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>Your use of our website and its content is at your own risk. The website and all content are provided "as is"
            and "as available" without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. We expressly disclaim all
            warranties, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement of third-party
            rights. We do not guarantee that the website will be error-free, secure, or continuously available.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Warranties and User Safeguards</h2>
        <p>We shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from
            your use or inability to use the website, including but not limited to lost profits, data loss, or business
            interruption, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
            applies to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

        <h2>Indemnities and Efficient Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless us, our subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, and employees from any
            claims, damages, losses, and costs (including legal fees) arising from your use of the website, your
            violation of these T&Cs, or your infringement of any third-party rights. For disputes related to these T&Cs,
