            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information You Provide Directly:</strong> This includes data you voluntarily enter, such as

                    contact form.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatically Collected Usage Data:</strong> When you visit our website, we automatically
                    collect certain technical information. This includes your IP address (anonymised), browser type and
                    version, operating system, the pages you visit on <strong>toolsandmachinery.co.uk</strong>, time
                    spent, access times, and referral pages (the page from which you came to us). This data helps us
